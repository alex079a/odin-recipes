        <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Rinse the peppers with cold water and cut off the stems. Slice the peppers in half, lengthwise, and discard the seeds and veins.</li>
        <li>Cut the flesh of the peppers into large pieces. You should end up with pieces about 1.5-inches square.</li>
        <li>Peel all the garlic cloves and mince. You can also use a garlic crusher or a cheese grater to speed up the proces</li>
        <li>In a large frying pan, add the olive oil and warm it over medium heat.</li>
        <li>When the olive oil is hot, add the peppers and garlic into the frying pan. Stir often until peppers are soft; this will also prevent the garlic from burning.</li>
        <li>Salt peppers to taste. Remove the peppers from the pan and place in a serving dish.</li>
        <li>To serve as a tapa, spoon some of the peppers onto slices of crusty, rustic bread or baguette. You could also arrange slices of bread next to a bowl with the peppers and provide a spoon for your guests to top the bread slices themselves. Enjoy hot, warm, or cold!</li>
